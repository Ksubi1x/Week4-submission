# Week4-submission

## For week 4, we had to make a quiz app. I was pretty stuck on how to approach this
so I decided to follow a long with a youtube video to help me out. Due to this, this submission 
probably doesn't count, but I atleast managed t learm some things while watching and coding along.
I learned how to replace the question and answers with DOM manipulation, which is something I really struggle with
and is something I want to get good at.
